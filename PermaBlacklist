impossible blacklist bypass, feel free to fork or whatever
currently no blacklisted users.
fun fact i made this in github, hopefully there isnt any bugs!

local GlobalPlayers = game:GetService("Players");
local LocalPlayer = Players.LocalPlayer;
local User = LocalPlayer.UserId;
local BLACKLISTED = {
   [USERIDHERE] = true;
}

if (BLACKLISTED[User]) then
   while true do
       print("skid")
       end
else
    print ("good job on not getting blacklisted ! :-) - devs")
end

if you dont know how this works let me explain.
the variable "GlobalPlayers" is ALL the players basically (you can use this for a global whitelist/blacklist.
the variable "LocalPLayer" is YOU! 
the variable "User" is YOUR userid!
and the variable "BLACKLISTED" >:( is the userid of the blacklisted user

"if (BLACKLISTED[User]) then
   while true do
       print("skid")
       end
else" .. psst, hey its me. I'm here to tell you how this works! :-)
ok so basically if the your userid matches the userid thats blacklisted it starts a script
"while true do
  print("skid")
  end
  
ok so how this works is a while true do statement basically means loop, but why not just kick the user? bypassing a local kick is very easy to bypass
but because there is no "wait()" statment in the script, it will repeat the "print ("skid")" statement so fast it will crash your game
  
"end
else"
ok so how this works is the else statement is basically if your userid does not math with the BLACKLISTED user variable it will print yay your not blacklisted
the script only crashes your game if your userid matches with the userid's in the BLACKLISTED variable, you can use this script to make a whitelist too! :-)
