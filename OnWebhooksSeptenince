Alright, so basically if you were to use a HTTP spy with Septenince you would probably find out there are AT THE WRITING OF THIS, 2 webhooks, now as some people may know
some scripts do log your ip with webhooks, Septenince does not and I can tell you what both webhooks are for:

So the first webhook is LITERALLY PUBLIC in the server, it just is for our "Report bugs" feature on the script.

Are second webhook is private, but just logs your username. Just incase you didnt know (not calling anyone out as i personally think its fine to do) Faded and Valiant and I'm
pretty sure swagmode does it too, all of these dh scripts I mentioned log ur username.

If you are not feeling safe using the script, I will reccomend you to use a VPN as your ip is hidden from attackers.

Septenince is open about using webhooks, as we want all users to know what we log for their safety.
